Homework module 5 - API's

API's were used to fetch the current BTC and ETH prices.  At the moment they are very low, but we anticipate them to do well in the next couple of years. :)

I used ALPACA's API's to get historical data for stocks and bonds, and ran some Monte Carlo simulations for 30 years.  It looks promising even for a $20000 investment, but I think I would use the $30000 one.


# Optional Challenge completed - Early retirement
I used an investment of $50000, and 10 years to retirement with a 80/20 weight split stocks/bonds.....Still don't think it is enough....Maybe some more crypto investments will pay off.
